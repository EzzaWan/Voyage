- Ensure good contrast and visibility

- **Memorable**: Distinctive and recognizable
- **Professional**: Suitable for a B2C marketplace

## Visual Concepts to Incorporate

### Primary Elements
1. **Travel/Exploration**: 
   - Subtle references to journeys, paths, or destinations
   - Could include: compass, map pin, route lines, or abstract travel paths
   - Avoid cliché travel icons (airplanes, suitcases) - be more abstract and modern

2. **Connectivity/Digital**:
   - Network nodes, signal waves, or connection points
   - Digital/tech aesthetic (but not too technical)
   - Could suggest: data flow, network connections, or signal strength

3. **Global Reach**:
   - Subtle world/globe reference (abstract, not literal)
   - Multiple connection points suggesting worldwide coverage
   - Could use: interconnected nodes, global network pattern

### Design Approach
- **Abstract Symbol**: Prefer abstract geometric shapes over literal icons
- **Letter Mark**: Could incorporate the letter "V" for Voyage in a stylized way
- **Combination Mark**: Symbol + wordmark that can work together or separately
- **Gradient Effects**: Subtle gradients from cyan to blue for depth and modernity

## Technical Specifications

### Logo Variations Needed
1. **Full Logo**: Symbol + "Voyage" wordmark (horizontal layout)
2. **Icon/Symbol Only**: Standalone symbol for app icon (must work at 1024x1024px)
3. **Wordmark Only**: Text "Voyage" in a custom font or stylized treatment
4. **Monochrome**: Single color version for dark/light backgrounds

### Size Requirements
- Must be legible and recognizable at 16x16px (favicon)
- Must work beautifully at 512x512px (app icon)
- Must scale to large sizes for website headers and marketing materials

### File Formats
- Vector format (SVG) for scalability
- High-resolution PNG with transparency
- Square format for app icons

## Design Inspiration Keywords
- Modern tech startups (Stripe, Linear, Vercel aesthetic)
- Travel tech apps (Airbnb, Booking.com - but more tech-forward)
- Connectivity/telecom (but more modern and less corporate)
- Minimalist geometric design
- Gradient-based modern logos

## What to Avoid
- Overly literal travel icons (airplanes, suitcases, passports)
- Corporate/telecom clichés (globe with lines, generic network icons)
- Too complex or detailed designs
- Designs that don't scale well
- Overly playful or casual (should feel premium)

## Final Prompt for Gemini

**Create a modern, minimalist logo for "Voyage" - an eSIM marketplace app for travelers. The logo should:**

1. **Be abstract and geometric** - use clean lines and shapes rather than literal icons
2. **Incorporate travel and connectivity themes** subtly - think interconnected paths, network nodes, or abstract journey symbols
3. **Use a bright blue color (#1E90FF)** as the primary color, with optional subtle cyan-to-blue gradients
4. **Work as both a symbol and with the wordmark "Voyage"** - create a combination mark that can be used together or separately
5. **Feel modern and tech-forward** - inspired by modern SaaS/travel tech brands, not corporate telecom
6. **Be highly scalable** - must work from 16px to 1024px sizes
7. **Have a premium, professional aesthetic** - suitable for a marketplace that serves global travelers

**The logo should suggest: global connectivity, seamless travel experiences, and modern digital innovation - all while remaining clean, memorable, and distinctive.**

## Additional Notes for Gemini

When generating the logo, consider:
- The "V" letterform could be integrated into the symbol design
- Abstract geometric shapes that suggest both travel (paths, routes) and connectivity (nodes, networks)
- A design that feels at home in both a mobile app icon and a website header
- Modern typography for the wordmark that complements the symbol
- Subtle depth through gradients or light effects, but keep it minimal

The final logo should make users think: "This is a modern, trustworthy app that will help me stay connected while traveling."
