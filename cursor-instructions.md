# Cursor Instructions

1. Read docs in `/docs/voyage/architecture.md` and `/docs/esim-access/` (PDFs) before implementing any logic.
2. Generate code using that document as source of truth.
3. Never guess API fields — always follow eSIM Access documentation or the architecture doc.
4. Maintain modular structure and shared libs (`libs/esim-access`, `libs/stripe`).
5. Prefer TypeScript for every service.
6. Do not implement UI styling yet — focus on structure and logic.
