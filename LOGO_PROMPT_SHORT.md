# Quick Copy-Paste Prompt for Gemini

```
Create a modern, minimalist logo for "Voyage" - an eSIM marketplace app that helps travelers stay connected in 190+ countries.

Design Requirements:
- Abstract geometric design (avoid literal travel icons like airplanes or suitcases)
- Primary color: Bright blue (#1E90FF) with optional cyan-to-blue gradients
- Must work at sizes from 16px to 1024px (app icon to website header)
- Create both a symbol/icon and a wordmark that work together or separately
- Modern, tech-forward aesthetic (think Stripe, Linear, Vercel - not corporate telecom)
- Subtle themes: global connectivity, travel/journeys, digital innovation

Visual Concepts:
- Abstract shapes suggesting interconnected paths, network nodes, or journey routes
- Could incorporate the letter "V" stylistically
- Clean, minimal, professional - suitable for a premium marketplace
- Works on both dark navy backgrounds (#0A1A2F) and light backgrounds

The logo should feel: modern, trustworthy, innovative, and travel-focused - making users think "This will help me stay connected while exploring the world."

Deliverables needed:
1. Full logo (symbol + "Voyage" wordmark, horizontal)
2. Icon only (for app icon, square format)
3. Wordmark only
4. Monochrome versions for different backgrounds
